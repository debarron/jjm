# jjm

Jenkins job monitor (duh), is a boring and simple script to check Jenkins jobs from command line. It's only informative.
BTW, brace yourselves for a bunch of emojis, I got carried away.

## Usage
Make sure to install libraries listed in `libs` text file.
After installing the libraries, run `jjm` by:

`python jjm -u jenkins_URL`

or

`python jjm -i file_with_jenkins_urls`

Cheers üçª !
